# APIcasso
JSON API development can get boring and time consuming. If you think it through, every time you make one you use almost the same route structure pointing the same controller actions, with the same features: ordering, filtering and pagination.
*APIcasso* is intended to be used as a full-fledged CRUD JSON API or as a base controller.

It makes development and easier job by abstracting route-based resource operations into API key scoping. This makes it possible to make CRUD-only applications just by creating functional Rails' models. The magic is done by a `.scope` JSON object which exists in every API key. It uses permission scopes as keys to restrict and extend APIcasso access to your application's resources.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'apicasso'
```

And then execute this to generate the required migrations:
```bash
$ rails g apicasso:install
```
You need a database with JSON fields support to use this gem.

## Usage
After installing APIcasso into your application you can mount a full-fledged CRUD JSON API just by mounting it into some path. Usually you will have it under a scoped route like `/api/v1` or something to separate it from your main application.
```ruby
  mount Apicasso::Engine, at: "/api/v1"
```
